# FilaKit Start Kit Filament 4.x and Laravel 12.x

## About FilaKit

FilaKit is a robust starter kit built on Laravel 12.x and Filament 4.x, designed to accelerate the development of modern
web applications with a ready-to-use multi-panel structure.

## Features

- **Laravel 12.x** - The latest version of the most elegant PHP framework
- **Filament 4.x** - Powerful and flexible admin framework
- **Multi-Panel Structure** - Includes three pre-configured panels:
    - Admin Panel (`/admin`) - For system administrators
    - App Panel (`/app`) - For authenticated application users
    - Public Panel (frontend interface) - For visitors
- **Environment Configuration** - Centralized configuration through the `config/filakit.php` file

## System Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer
- Node.js and PNPM

## Installation

Clone the repository
``` bash
laravel new my-app --using=jeffersongoncalves/filakitv4 --database=mysql
```

###  Easy Installation

FilaKit can be easily installed using the following command:

```bash
php install.php
```

This command automates the installation process by:
- Installing Composer dependencies
- Setting up the environment file
- Generating application key
- Setting up the database
- Running migrations
- Installing Node.js dependencies
- Building assets
- Configuring Herd (if used)

### Manual Installation

Install JavaScript dependencies
``` bash
pnpm install
```
Install Composer dependencies
``` bash
composer install
```
Set up environment
``` bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Configure your database in the .env file

Run migrations
``` bash
php artisan migrate
```
Run the server
``` bash
php artisan serve
```

## Installation with Docker

Clone the repository
```bash
laravel new my-app --using=jeffersongoncalves/filakitv4 --database=mysql
```

Move into the project directory
```bash
cd my-app
```

Install Composer dependencies
```bash
composer install
```

Set up environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Configuring custom ports may be necessary if you have other services running on the same ports.

```bash
# Application Port (ex: 8080)
APP_PORT=8080

# MySQL Port (ex: 3306)
FORWARD_DB_PORT=3306

# Redis Port (ex: 6379)
FORWARD_REDIS_PORT=6379

# Mailpit Port (ex: 1025)
FORWARD_MAILPIT_PORT=1025
```

Start the Sail containers
```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
```
You won’t need to run `php artisan serve`, as Laravel Sail automatically handles the development server within the container.

Attach to the application container
```bash
./vendor/bin/sail shell
```

Generate the application key
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

Install JavaScript dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

## Authentication Structure

FilaKit comes pre-configured with a custom authentication system that supports different types of users:

- `Admin` - For administrative panel access
- `User` - For application panel access

## Development

``` bash
# Run the development server with logs, queues and asset compilation
composer dev

# Or run each component separately
php artisan serve
php artisan queue:listen --tries=1
pnpm run dev
```

## Customization

### Panel Configuration

Panels can be customized through their respective providers:

- `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php`
- `app/Providers/Filament/AppPanelProvider.php`
- `app/Providers/Filament/PublicPanelProvider.php`

Alternatively, these settings are also consolidated in the `config/filakit.php` file for easier management.

### Themes and Colors

Each panel can have its own color scheme, which can be easily modified in the corresponding Provider files or in the
`filakit.php` configuration file.

### Configuration File

The `config/filakit.php` file centralizes the configuration of the starter kit, including:

- Panel routes
- Middleware for each panel
- Branding options (logo, colors)
- Authentication guards

## User Profile — joaopaulolndev/filament-edit-profile

This project already comes with the Filament Edit Profile plugin integrated for the Admin and App panels. It adds a complete profile editing page with avatar, language, theme color, security (tokens, MFA), browser sessions, and email/password change.

- Routes (defaults in this project):
  - Admin: /admin/my-profile
  - App: /app/my-profile
- Navigation: by default, the page does not appear in the menu (shouldRegisterNavigation(false)). If you want to show it in the sidebar menu, change it to true in the panel provider.

Where to configure
- Panel providers
  - Admin: app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php
  - App: app/Providers/Filament/AppPanelProvider.php
  In these files you can adjust:
  - ->slug('my-profile') to change the URL (e.g., 'profile')
  - ->setTitle('My Profile') and ->setNavigationLabel('My Profile')
  - ->setNavigationGroup('Group Profile'), ->setIcon('heroicon-o-user'), ->setSort(10)
  - ->shouldRegisterNavigation(true|false) to show/hide it in the menu
  - Shown forms: ->shouldShowEmailForm(), ->shouldShowLocaleForm([...]), ->shouldShowThemeColorForm(), ->shouldShowSanctumTokens(), ->shouldShowMultiFactorAuthentication(), ->shouldShowBrowserSessionsForm(), ->shouldShowAvatarForm()

- General settings: config/filament-edit-profile.php
  - locales: language options available on the profile page
  - locale_column: column used in your model for language/locale (default: locale)
  - theme_color_column: column for theme color (default: theme_color)
  - avatar_column: avatar column (default: avatar_url)
  - disk: storage disk used for the avatar (default: public)
  - visibility: file visibility (default: public)

Migrations and models
- The required columns are already included in this kit’s default migrations (users and admins): avatar_url, locale and theme_color, using the names defined in config/filament-edit-profile.php.
- The App\Models\User and App\Models\Admin models already read the avatar using the plugin configuration (getFilamentAvatarUrl).

Avatar storage
- Make sure the filesystem disk is configured and that the storage link exists:
  php artisan storage:link
- Adjust the disk and visibility in the config file according to your infrastructure.

Quick access
- Via direct URL: /admin/my-profile or /app/my-profile
- To make it visible in the sidebar navigation, set shouldRegisterNavigation(true) in the respective Provider.
